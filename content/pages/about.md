Sangwoong Yoon
===================

I am a Ph.D. student at [Robotics Laboratory](http://robotics.snu.ac.kr/fcp/) (advisor: Prof. Frank Chongwoo Park) in Seoul National University.
In general, I love building machine learning algorithms in a principled manner, e.g. by using information theory or taking a probabilistic approach.
Currently, my research focuses on out-of-distribution detection based on generative machine learning.
I am also closely working with Prof. Yung-Kyun Noh (Hanyang University).
