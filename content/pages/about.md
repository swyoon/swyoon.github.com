===================

I am a Ph.D. student at Robotics Laboratory (advisor: Prof. Frank Chongwoo Park) in Seoul National University, and a research scientist intern at Kakao Braion Inc. I am deeply interested in understanding fundamental ideas in machine learning. My research interest includes information theory, nonparametric algorithms, and decision making under uncertainty. I am also closely working with Prof. Yung-Kyun Noh (Hanyang University).
