        I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://sites.google.com/robotics.snu.ac.kr/fcp/">Robotics Laboratory</a>
        (advisor: Prof. Frank Chongwoo Park) in <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr">Seoul National University</a>.
        My adviosr is Prof. Frank Chongwoo Park, and I also work closely with Prof. Yung-Kyun Noh (Hanyang University).
        I am deeply interested in discovering principles of learning and using them to build better learning algorithms.
        My recent research aims to address the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can we make a machine learning algorithm better by taking a probabilistic approach?  </li>
            <li>What are the limitations of the probabilistic approach in machine learning?</li>
            <li>What are the uncertainties in machine learning and how can we measure them?</li>
            <li>Can we make a better decision using the knowledge on the uncertainty?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
