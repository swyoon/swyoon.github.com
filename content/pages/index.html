        <p>
            I currently serve as an AI Research Fellow at <a href="https://kias.re.kr/">Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS)</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://sites.google.com/robotics.snu.ac.kr/fcp/home">Robotics Laboratory</a> 
            at Seoul National University, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/robotics.snu.ac.kr/fcp/people/faculty?authuser=0">Prof. Frank C. Park</a>. 
            Additionally, I earned a master's degree in Neuroscience from the same university, guided by <a href="https://bi.snu.ac.kr/~btzhang/">Prof. Byoung-Tak Zhang</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond academia, I have accumulated valuable industrial experience. I contributed Amazon as an applied scientist intern and Kakao Brain as a reserach scientist intern. 
            I also held a full-time position as a machine learning scientist at Haezoon Inc. and Saige Research, which are start-up companies located at Seoul.
        </p>

        <p>
            My academic endeavors have earned me several accolades.
            I received the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award from Department of Mechanical Engineering at Seoul National University.
            I also garnered recognition through the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2021-south-korea">Qualcomm AI Fellowship Korea 2021</a> 
            and <a href="https://aiis.snu.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=eng4_3&sca=2021">Youlchon AI Stars Fellowship 2021</a>.
            Furthermore, my work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05735">normalized autoencoder</a>, was awarded with both Best Poster Award and Most Popular Poster Award at the Machine Learning Summer School 2021 (MLSS 2021).
        </p>

        <p>
            My research is centered on understanding probabilistic learning principles and building their practical applications.
            I am deeply engaged with generative models, especially energy-based and diffusion models, exploring their potential in areas 
            such as out-of-distribution detection, reinforcement learning, robotics, and decision-making under uncertainty.
        </p>             

        <p>
            I am open for collaboration and also looking for postdoc opportunities outside Korea. Please contact me at <b>sangwoong24yoon at gmail.com</b>.
